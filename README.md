# Contextual-Language-Generation-with-LSTM
This project develops an **LSTM-based Neural Text Generation** model, trained on a Vietnamese corpus to predict the next word. It solves a multi-class classification problem by learning context from a 50-word input window. The implementation emphasizes efficient data handling via a custom generator and robust Vietnamese preprocessing using `pyvi`.
